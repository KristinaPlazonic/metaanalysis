# metaanalysis


## Explanation of the contents

- folder `titles` has the csv files that were the result of pubmed search with: 
    + since year 2000
    + have meta-analysis or systematic review in the title
    + has tuberculosis in the title
    + each file's name begins with the keyword that was searched for in the abstract: e.g. keyword `gender` results in file `gender_titles_meta_tb_2000.csv` 

- `number_of_tuberculosis_metaanalysis_since_2000.csv` is the number of hits in Pubmed corresponding with certain keywords. It's a summary of the data that is in `titles` folder. 
- `metaanalisys_tb_ratio.png` - for the keyword `ratio`, display the results graphically
- `meta_2000_tuberculosis_ratio.csv` - for the keyword `ratio` - same as `titles/ratio_titles_meta_tb_2000.csv`  - I'm keeping it here since I generated it first and already sent links to people referencing it.
